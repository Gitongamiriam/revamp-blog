I love coming up with solutions to solve problems in society through IT as a Developer. I'm committed and results-driven fullstack developer and deep understanding of the software development Life Cycle. I have a history of repeated success in agile development from inception to excution by strategically allocating resources and delegating task to achieve on-time, on-budget delivery. Through running our family business which provides office workers with clothing and accessories. I accquired skills to enhance those that I learned in school. I am becoming a valuable engineer.
